* You must have a class for your Tamagotchi, a `game` object, and event listeners/handlers at the bottom that call methods in your `game` object.  There should be **no** other code in the global scope.
* You must build incrementally and make commits as you go.  You will be expected to show a commit history that reflects taking careful measured steps and building one feature at a time. 
  
* Create a repo for your Tamagotchi pet on github.com and make the link available in your class Slack channel.

* Create a `class` for your Tamagotchi.  The Tamagotchi should have the following properties:
  * hunger (1-10 scale)
  * sleepiness (1-10 scale)
  * boredom (1-10 scale)
  * age
  * name




class Tommy {
	constructors() {
		this.name = name
		this.age = age
		this.hunger = hunger
		this.sleepiness = sleepiness
		this.boredom = boredom
	}

  }
